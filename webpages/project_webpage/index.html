        <!-- Approach -->
        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <h4>What did you do exactly? How did you solve the problem? Why did you think it would be successful? Is
            anything new in your approach?</h4>

        <h4>How did you measure success? What datasets did you use and what experiments did you carry out? What were the
            results, both quantitative and qualitative? Did you succeed? Did you fail? Why?</h4>

        <!-- Analysis -->
        <h2>Analysis</h2>
        <h4>Do the results make sense? Why or why not? Describe what kind of visualization/analysis you performed in
            order to verify that your results 1) are correct and 2) explain differences in performance from what was
            expected (e.g. what appeared in papers). Provide specific claims about why you think your model is or is not
            doing better, and justify those with qualitative and quantitative experiments (not necessarily just final
            accuracy numbers, but statistics or other data about what the model is doing).</h4>

        <!-- Team -->
        <h2>Team Member Identification</h2>
        <h4>Provide a list of team members and what each member did in a table. When an algorithm was implemented,
            provide specifics as to which parts your team member implemented and which parts were leveraging open-source
            code. <b>Your project should include doing something beyond just downloading open-source code and tuning
                hyper-parameters</b>. This can include implementation of additional approaches (if leveraging
            open-source code), theoretical analysis, or a thorough investigation of some phenomena. When using external
            resources, provide references to anything you used in the README!</h4>
